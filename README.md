# Examples

This section of ScreenPy contains some fully-fleshed (albeit maybe a bit contrived) examples of some test suites, which show off how a test suite written in the Screenplay Pattern architecture might look. Feel free to reference these if you aren't sure how certain pieces fit together.

## `screenpy`

Examples using just the base library!
These ones will show you
how to add your own Abilities,
Actions,
Questions,
etc.
in order to build your own test suite.

### Read The Docs

This example is the contrivance used
for the latest docs: [ScreenPy Complete Example](https://screenpy-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html).
Neat!
## `screenpy_selenium`

Examples of using
[screenpy_selenium](https://screenpy-selenium-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to do automated browser testing.

### GitHub

A very small example that shows off entering text and clicking around a few GitHub pages. It uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)'s test organization style.

### The Internet

A slightly larger example that goes to [The Internet](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/) and interacts with some of the widgets there. It uses [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)'s test organization style.

## `screenpy_requests`

Examples of using
[screenpy_requests](https://screenpy-requests-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to do automated API testing.

### HTTPBin

A quick example suite
that demonstrates
how to structure an API test suite.
This suite runs tests against [HTTPBin](https://httpbin.org/).
