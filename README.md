Examples
========

This section of ScreenPy contains some fully-fleshed (albeit maybe a bit contrived) examples of some test suites, which show off how a test suite written in the Screenplay Pattern architecture might look. Feel free to reference these if you aren't sure how certain pieces fit together.

GitHub
------

A very small example that shows off entering text and clicking around a few GitHub pages. It uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)'s test organization style.

The Internet
------------

A slightly larger example that goes to [The Internet](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/) and interacts with some of the widgets there. It uses [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)'s test organization style.
